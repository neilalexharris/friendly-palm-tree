			<p>
				My background is as an international track and field athlete, I have a wealth of experience as an elite athlete over 100m, 200m and 400m.
				I competed for Great Britain and England on many occasions and incorporate the benefits of this rare insight into the world of elite sport with all my personal training.
				I want to share the knowledge I have gained, as all of this experience can be adapted and benefit PT sessions.

				It was a huge lesson in the right and wrong ways of exercising the body! I want to pass all of this experience on - so people can have a long and healthy
				relationship with exercise, doing types of exercise that are sustainable and become part of your lifestyle.
