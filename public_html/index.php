						I started my career in London, having trained under the guidance of Matt Roberts in Chelsea. I quickly developed an effective approach that led to results.
						My clients learned to train effectively, improving both their fitness and emotional wellbeing, feeling uplifted after sessions.
					</p></br>

					<p>
						I train a number of high profile clients, these have included individual members of the girl band The Saturdays and Colin Jackson.
						But I also work with a lot of people locally from older ladies wanting to regain their confidence to incorporate exercise into their lives to someone who wants to train quietly, building belief.
					</p></br>

					<p>
						When I train my clients it is important that I get a result that benefits both the body and the mind. Under my guidance I will help you to train intuitively so you will leave a session feeling
						energised, uplifted and inspired to keep exercising, making it part of your life. (??rather than feeling drained and not wanting to come back, as is seen all to often these days with PT!
					</p></br>

					<p>
						There is also information overload when it comes to health and fitness. It is confusing!! And can be rather off putting.
						I want to help you to cut through all of the fads and get on with effective training, that is designed just for you.
						I will help you with exercise and nutrition and guide you to a happy healthier lifestyle.
					</p></br>

						Perhaps add the following I have written to what is already there - but do cut some of the original out.</br>
						Banners / Quotation Wording Options - these are for various pages and may work better on one page than another)
					</p></br>
					<p>
						“I design your workout based on your needs.”</br>
						“It is important to me that all of my clients leave feeling emotionally refreshed, as well as having a physical workout.”</br>
						When I train someone it is important to me that they leave feeling mentally uplifted, and emotionally refreshed.”</br>
						“By working the body intuitively, gains can be made not only physically but emotionally and this for me is the key to an effective workout.”
						 - this is a really important message about my training to get across and should feature on a front page</br>
						“The right type of exercise leaves you feeling refreshed, it makes everything feel that litle bit more manageable”</br>
						“Today there is so much focus on exercising to achieve a certain body, the world has become obsessed with body image.
						I don’t believe that with this as the driving force, that exercise is sustainable. I like to focus on exercise for health and wellbeing - the rest will take care of itself as a byproduct”</br>
